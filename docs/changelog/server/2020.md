### DZ / Expedition System

The expedition system enables the ability to create Dynamic Zone instances managed by the client's Expedition interface window. This system allows clients to add and remove members of a Dynamic Zone while providing built-in event lockout timer support.

The system is currently quest driven and provides quest APIs to create zone instances without the burden of manually tracking and validating lockout conflicts among characters. The system should have zero impact on servers that don't make use of it.

#### Summary of additions

* Added `Expeditions` and `DynamicZones` logging categories
* Added `Expedition` and `DynamicZone` rule categories
* Added database tables `expeditions`, `expedition_lockouts`, `expedition_members`, `character_expedition_lockouts`, and `dynamic_zones`
* Added `#dz` GM/developer command (minimum status 80)
* Added `#dzkickplayers` client command (minimum status 0)
  * This performs the `/kickplayers exp` command for pre-RoF clients
* Added Lua and Perl expedition quest APIs
* Updated opcodes used for client expedition window and /dz commands
  * Opcodes only updated for Titanium, SoD, Underfoot, and RoF2 clients (SoF and RoF1 clients may be missing functionality)

For more details and quest API usage see the [Expedition System](../../../../server/expedition-system) documentation.

**Fixed bugged pet buttons (sit and taunt)**

The pet window sit button **was** often out of sync. Also pet's were frequently still marked as sitting internal to the server due to the owner being attacked, or other issues.

A pet on guard will always return to guard after a battle. A pet sitting, will switch to follow mode after a battle. Pet HP sitting regen bonus will now only happen when the pet is actually ooc and sitting.

After hearing from [@Trust](https://github.com/Trust) that the taunt button was also out of sync often, I looked into that as well.

The client stores the status of an active pet's taunt setting. This is stored across sessions. The old approach was to try and force taunt on, on pet creation as well as logging on and zoning. Client messages, sometimes in response to out attempts, would end up toggling our taunt value away from what we just set it to.

Taunt now behaves as follows:

**Clients previous to UF**

Only client on/off clicks change state. Default is taunt on. Zoning and logging on both default to true.

UF+ Clients:

**On 1st time pet summoning via spell:**

The pet is created with taunting off. This matches the client.

**On logging in with an existing pet:**

The client sends a message if the pet was taunting when you logged off, which will turn it on, since pet creation now defaults to taunting=false in the constructor.

**On zoning:**

The pet's state is set from it's saved value in the database. The client is not involved, but will match as pet state is preserved by the client across zoning.

**On suspend minion:**

The pet's state is set from it's saved value in the database. The client is not involved, but will match as pet state is preserved by the client across zoning.

**Added new quest api to lua and perl to allow quests to enable/disable mob processing in empty zones.**

This topic in general deserves some discussion. In empty zones, mob processing typically does not take place, but quest timers do fire. Over the past year I have added multiple enhancements to this, and this is the latest of those enhancements.

Calling the quest::processmobswhilezoneempty(1/0) or lua counterpart eq.process_mobs_while_zone_empty(true**/**false) from a quest file enables or disables normal processing of mobs (movement, aggro, etc) in a zone, even when that zone is empty. Without these calls, a quest that say, happens once an hour and involves mobs spawning, moving and attacking (each other) would operate correctly in an empty zone.

In the **past** few months I added these other enhancements along the same line:

**A rule that allows mob processing to continue for a set # of seconds after the zone goes empty. This allows mobs that chased someone to a zone line for example, to move back rather than just standing at the zone line.**

RULE_INT(Zone, SecondsBeforeIdle, 60, "Seconds before IDLE_WHEN_EMPTY define kicks in")

**Allowing grid types 4 and 6 to always process, even when zone is empty.**

This change allows mobs like Fippy that spawn and run a fixed grid and despawn to complete their run on time, rather than always running the second someone enters a zone that was empty. This could be used for boats on servers, if they are placed on one of these types of grids.

This is the current logic that dictates mob processing. So mob processing occurs if the flag process_mobs_while_empty is set (this is the new quest api I just added), there are clients in the zone, the mob is on a grid that despawns at the end, or the zone is settling after all clients have left (my rule I added above).

```text
if (zone->process_mobs_while_empty || numclients > 0 ||
            mob->GetWanderType() == 4 || mob->GetWanderType() == 6 ||
            mob_settle_timer->Enabled())
```

### **Virtual Zone Points (ZoneLines)**

[This PR adds support for virtual zone points _**_](https://github.com/EQEmu/Server/pull/1106)****

Because the zone points that are sent to the client use an internal index lookup, it does not really give us power over determining or creating zone points in some cases. While this works in most of the data we've collected, there are scenarios where we'd like to create zone points entirely server side

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3319450/143403222-1a64a748-7614-4f13-85ca-8073eb1ac47b.png)

We've added 3 new fields to the `zone_points` table `is_virtual` `width` `height`

When a zone point is virtual it follows different rules, a box is created using the x, y, z with the width and the height into consideration

New command **#showzonepoints** will list all of the zone points in a zone whether they are client side driven or virtual. It will also show a physical representation of the zone points in game

### Enhanced DevTools Menu

DevTools menu now displays whenever a GM enters a zone, it also has many more tools available

### Loot Drop Filtering Adjustments

[https://github.com/EQEmu/Server/pull/1105](https://github.com/EQEmu/Server/pull/1105)

* Add new logging category "Loot"
* Adds fields `npc_min_level` and `npc_max_level` to `lootdrop_entries` which runs checks against the current NPC as long as the field values are non-zero
* Fields `minlevel` and `maxlevel` are renamed to `trivial_min_level` and `trivial_max_level` respectively for `lootdrop_entries` for item drops to be filtered based on the player level
* Before, `trivial_max_level` defaulted to `127` in the database, this became an issue on some servers and some scenarios, the default has been adjusted to simply be 0 and only check if the value is non-zero

### General

* Add `Merchants` and `ZonePoints` logging categories
* Add fix for object display issues on RoF2 where objects would float, we are using GroundZ to correct these. Previous clients auto corrected objects and snapped them to the ground level, newer clients do not do this
* Added `WorldContentService` which has the responsibility of setting / getting content context for the server, expansions, flags etc.
* Added an optional second database connection to the config "content_database" that will use a separate database connection for queries that target content tables. If none is specified it falls back to the default connection pointer
* Added connection labels to MySQL connect messages
* Added magical global helper methods `ZoneID(string short_name)` `ZoneName(zone_id)` `ZoneLongName(zone_id)` which are all pre-loaded in memory to be used at the zone or world level for common needs
* Added official single source of truth in `database_schema.h` which defines different table types `player`, `content`, `server`, `state`, `queryserv`, `login`, `version`
* Fix issues with world CLI interface returning exit code 1 (error) versus exit code 0 (success)
* Saylinks are added to `#fi` command for summoning items

### Performance Improvements

* Task goallists now bulk load
* Spawns prefer bulk loading
* Improvements to grid loading logic (bulk load)

### New Commands

* Added in-command `#gearup` - which takes in tooling data to automatically gear a GM test toon with expansion specific best-in-class gear
* Added in-game command `#copycharacter [source_char_name] [dest_char_name] [dest_account_name]`
* `Added console CLI command via world character:copy-character`

### Repositories

**Highlights**

* Heavily reducing the mental overhead of having to interact with the database at the programmatic level
* It creates an object representation of our tables (persistence layer) with a 1:1 mapping with what is in the source by having row values stored in a struct (Data Transfer Object)
* We reduce manual overhead by having code generation generate our database table representations
* Ease of maintenance; whenever we make schema changes, rerunning the repository updates fields and subsequent methods keeping code changes minimal 

**Methods Implemented**

* Single insertion covered by `InsertOne`
* Single update covered by `UpdateOne`
* Single delete covered by `DeleteOne`
* Single select covered by `FindOne`
* Bulk selection method via filtered `GetWhere(std::string where_filter)`
* Bulk deletion method via filtered `DeleteWhere(std::string where_filter)`
* Bulk insertion methods handled automatically via `InsertMany`
* Select all covered by `All`

**Code Generation**

This is a result of the repository generator located at

```text

* Fixed an issue where when a client first enters a zone; an NPC may not be aware of their presence immediately
* Fixed a UCS issue where a crash or another UCS connection would delete connection pointers; this should keep UCS connected more reliably
* Lowered the rate in which animation packets are throttled to 500ms from 1000ms; this should keep faster animations from being gated from being sent

Updated #grid show command to use alphabetic names so names display properly (numerics were getting stripped) and stacked the names of nodes that are in the same #loc.

Added code to make sure that mobs that call for help, complete that activity before starting to move toward target. As written (previously) a mob could be out of earshot of his neighbors because movement started immediately. It was a race condition that nearly always resulted in mobs within the attacked mobs assist radius not hearing the call.

Added command #findrace [name|id].

### UCS / Raid / Zone Fixes

**Raid::GetRaidByClient**

On PEQ we noticed via zone with high CPU footprint spending tons of time in in function `Raid::GetRaidByClient` where we excessively loop through all raids in zone, all members in the raid to return back a simple raid pointer. Now, we cache the pointer lookup instead of running the entire loop constantly. For perspective, with 100 toons in a zone all in a raid, you will easily see 4k/s calls to this function which adds up on a CPU profile (nuts)

**CPU Profile** [https://gist.github.com/Akkadius/a5c55654d4b729697964f938c824030f](https://gist.github.com/Akkadius/a5c55654d4b729697964f938c824030f)  
**Call Measurement Example**

```text
eqemu@ce0931611614:~$ tail -f ~/server/logs/**/*.log | grep "returning cached raid" | pv -lr 2>&1 >/dev/null
[4.04k/s]
```

**UCS**

We also noticed UCS sucking up a lot of CPU with 1,500 players online

**CPU Profile** [https://gist.github.com/Akkadius/14efe565caf468cc892293fd95cc0377](https://gist.github.com/Akkadius/14efe565caf468cc892293fd95cc0377)

* Converted to a less aggressive loop frequency 31.25 FPS and converted to using UV library
* No longer load characters into UCS context that are soft deleted
* Fixed UCS bug where it would not reconnect properly after a crash / improper shutdown
* Fixed UCS bug where it was not registering a new connection properly, and sending a "Not Available" to all zones right after it is in fact "Available"
* Added Logging in zone that clearly says whether or not UCS is online or not
* Properly removing UCS connected clients even if the /q /ex connections resolving by sending keepalive packets [#735](https://github.com/EQEmu/Server/issues/735) this prevents UCS from looping over ghosted clients making unnecessary database calls and sending improper connected client counts
* Removed tons of verbose LogInfo logging and replaced the calls for LogDebug as it was writing to disk excessively for mostly debugging related information

**Zone**

* We are now properly shutting down zone processes by killing the UV loop instead of doing a hard process exit, allowing the zone to shut everything else down gracefully

### Implement SendToGuildHall and Improve Instance ID Cycling

Instead of purging immediately expired instances every 7.5 minutes, we will purge expired instances from the database table after they've been completely expired for an entire day every 7.5 minutes. The reason for this is that the code will still determine that an instance is expired when it needs to; but in order to not re-use the same instance ID not long after it had been freed while a zone is still online with the same instance ID, we're simply going to wait a grace period of 1 day to purge those entries as it will not harm anything

Client::SendToGuildHall() will send a client to a Guild Hall instance for 90 days based on a configurable rule. This will send the player to a Guild Hall instance regardless of whether they are in a Guild or not and it is up to the discretion of the server operator to check for guild id before making the call. If you are not guilded, you share an instance with other non-guilded players

We pull instance remaining time out of the database once on zone bootup because the timer class is returning the value in milliseconds which causes the values to overflow and improperly show remaining instance time for instances that are open for long period of time

Created new rule category `Instances`

```text
RULE_INT(Instances, ReservedInstances, 30, "Will reserve this many instance ids for globals... probably not a good idea to change this while a server is running")
RULE_BOOL(Instances, RecycleInstanceIds, true, "Will recycle free instance ids instead of gradually running out at 32k")
RULE_INT(Instances, GuildHallExpirationDays, 90, "Amount of days before a Guild Hall instance expires")
```

This exports Lua / Perl method `client->SendToGuildHall`

* Added a new field (always_aggro_foes) to npc_types.  If non-zero, the npc/mob will always aggro foes regardless of intelligence or level.  This was so mobs such as the int casters in Befallen, who will agro their enemies regardless of level and I didn't want to have to reduce the _int field of INT caster NPCs to achieve the aggro.

### Monk Bot Changes

* Added a 'monk' class special attack timer to class NPC
* Monk bots will now use the ability `Tiger Claw` on a seperate timer from the other disciplines - resulting in an additional attack
* Bot usage of `Master Wu's Technique` now falls inline with current client behavior (rules and all)
* Added bot owner option `monkwumessage` to toggle a notification message to the bot's owner whenever `MWT` triggers (off by default .. use `^oo monkwumessage` to enable/disable)

**Special Note:**

By default, all classes process class attacks based on active timers. This involves checking attackability of target with every call - which is VERY expensive when done every server processing cycle since the timer is always 'ready.'

I added code to disable 'class' timers in classes that don't use them or are inactive because they don't have a skill. Class-based timers will not reactivate..but, skill-based ones will once a `CalcBotStats` call is made during the 'leveling' process. (If the skill is not available after leveling, the timer will disable itself again.)

Hopefully, this will help reduce bot cpu usage.

Please report any issues on our forums or in Discord - Thanks!

### **Auto Consent Implemented with Group / Raid / Guild Consent**

* Auto Consent client options are now supported. Toggling these options results in consenting (or denying) a player's current corpses.
  * These options are now also saved and restored for characters.
* The /consent and /deny commands for group, raid, and guild are now implemented. These commands are not case sensitive.
  * `/consent group` - adds current group id to all character corpses
  * `/consent raid` - adds current raid id to all character corpses
  * `/consent guild` - adds current guild id to all corpses and updates db
  * `/deny group|raid|guild` - sets the consent type id to 0 on all corpses
* Consent and deny commands are throttled to once every two seconds
* When consenting a player by name, both the corpse owner and the player being consented receive a message for every (loaded) zone a corpse is in.
* Corpses now store the list of consented player names. Previously clients stored a list of players they could drag corpses for.

Guild consent is persistent. The `character_corpses` table has a new `guild_consent_id`column which is updated when a player issues a guild consent command. This means guild consented corpses may be dragged by guild members after a corpse is loaded (summoning the corpse to another zone or loading the corpse in a previously unloaded zone)

Group and raid consent are not persistent. Corpses will lose these consents when a corpse is summoned or if the corpse is loaded by a zone after consent was issued.

### Update to EVENT_COMMAND and EVENT_BOT_COMMAND

The handlers for EVENT_COMMAND and EVENT_BOT_COMMAND have been updated to allow a 'no change' behavior.

Script files using these event types will perform as before without the need to move the command scripting into them .. so long as there is no defined function for them.

Once a definition is given, the old method of using EVENT_SAY to handle them will no longer work and the new formatting must be applied.

If you have any questions, please direct them to our forums or the `#support-quest-scripts` channel in discord.

### Character Soft Deletes

Unless new system rule **Character:SoftDeletes** (default: true) is disabled, characters will now no longer hard delete from all respective character tables and will only be marked as deleted via the newly created `deleted_at` column that can be found in the `character_data` table. This can make it far easier to recover accidentally deleted characters

### EVENT_COMMAND and EVENT_BOT_COMMAND

* EVENT_COMMAND now processes its own code and is no longer shared with EVENT_SAY
* EVENT_BOT_COMMAND was added..but, will have limited functionality until more of the Bot class is exposed in the scripting apis
* Both event types have new or updated entries on the [Events](https://docs.eqemu.io/quest-api/events/) page
* In the template scripts, just replace the example command data with your own
* Perl: `"command_name" => [<status_required>, "command_description"]`
* Lua: `["command_name"] = {<status_required>, "command_description"}`
* Anything in the `command_data` hash will be automatically parsed upon any `#help` call - to include partial matching criteria
* The same is true for `bot_command_data`
* These templates are not required for use..but, do provide a basic 'use' structure so that command coding is simplified and easier to implement
* Older 'say' command code may still work as-is..though, it has not been tested
