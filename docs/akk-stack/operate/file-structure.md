    This page shows the structure of the **akk-stack** file system and how to interact with it.

## Standard Server Directories

Within the **eqemu-server** container, the fileystem is ephermeral, meaning it will not persist through a reboot. The
following directories noted that are shared to the host and will persist through a reboot.

| Directory                | Details                                                                                                                                                                                            |

## Symlinked Directories

* Server binaries - Never need to copy binaries after a compile
* Patch files
* Quests
* Plugins
* LUA Modules

Symlinks are created on bootup of the container and are not ones you need to manage yourself and are here for
convenience.

This means that when the **~/code** directory is updated via **git pull** the opcodes and patch files are automatically
updated.

When you compile new binaries, the symlinks are automatically updated to the new binaries in the **~/server/bin**
directory.
