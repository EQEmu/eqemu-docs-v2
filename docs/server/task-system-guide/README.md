# Task System

The EQEmu Task System allows implementation of quests that utilize the clients Task Window (alt+Q).  Many aspects of this system can be found throughout this wiki; this guide attempts to organize that information on a single page to inform the reader who wishes to understand and utilize the Task System.

Much of the Task System functionality can be found in [/zones/task.cpp](https://github.com/EQEmu/Server/blob/master/zone/tasks.cpp) and should be referenced by those comfortable with looking at the EQEmu source code.

!!! danger
      Overlapping proximities will only trigger proximity detection for the proximity with the lowest-numbered **exploreid**.


### Tasksets Table

!!! info
      Task Sets are intended to make it easier to write quest NPCs that can offer a lot of tasks. While this functionality can also be achieved with quest::assigntask, it is important to note that players can remove tasks when writing your scripts.  A Task Set could require a series of tasks in a progression.

## Logging Options

!!! info
      These options are present in the Logging System through [logsys_categories](https://docs.eqemu.io/schema/admin/logsys_categories/) or in-game via command #logs set [output] [type] [level]


```sql
1 LOG_CATEGORY( TASKS )
2 LOG_TYPE( TASKS, GLOBALLOAD, DISABLED )
3 LOG_TYPE( TASKS, CLIENTLOAD, DISABLED )
4 LOG_TYPE( TASKS, UPDATE, DISABLED )
5 LOG_TYPE( TASKS, CLIENTSAVE, DISABLED )
6 LOG_TYPE( TASKS, PACKETS, DISABLED )
7 LOG_TYPE( TASKS, PROXIMITY, DISABLED )
```

TASKS UPDATE is used to print out debug information when checking if activities are completed.

## Quest API (for the task system)

These are the **quest::[methods]** and **EVENT** triggers that are related to the Task System.
