        <p>Causes an NPC to alternate between a random waypoint in grid_entries and
          a random waypoint marked with the center point column set to true. If no
          waypoints are marked as a center point, this wander type will not work.
          There is no numbering requirement or limit for center points--you can have
          as many as you need.</p>
