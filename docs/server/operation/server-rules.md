# Server Rules

### Editing rules

To edit rules, you can use the [`#rules set [Name] [Value]`](https://docs.eqemu.io/server/operation/in-game-command-reference) command to set a rule. 

You can then use [`#reload rules`](https://docs.eqemu.io/server/operation/loading-server-data/) to force all zones to reload the new rules. 

!!! warning
      The `notes` field in the database is set by the server software.  If you adjust the values in the field, they will be overwritten and restored to default values when you update your server binaries.


!!! info
      If you would like to improve upon the descriptions or notes in the Server Rules table, please submit a pull request on the [ruletypes](https://github.com/EQEmu/Server/blob/master/common/ruletypes.h) header file.
