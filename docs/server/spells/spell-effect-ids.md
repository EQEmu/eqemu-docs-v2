| 472 | SE_Buy_AA_Rank | Toggle Passive AA Rank | Used in AA abilities that have Enable/Disable toggle. Spell on Disabled Rank has this effect in it. | 1 | none | none | Certain AA, like Weapon Stance line use a special toggle Hotkey to enable or disable the AA's passive abilities.  This is occurs by doing the following. Each 'rank' of Weapon Stance is actually 2 actual ranks.   First rank is always the Disabled version which cost X amount of AA, this is the rank that SPA 472 goes in. Second rank is the Enabled version which cost 0 AA.  When you buy the first rank, you make a hotkey that on live say 'Weapon Stance Disabled', if you clik that it then BUYS the  next rank of AA (cost 0) which switches the hotkey to 'Enabled Weapon Stance' and you are given the passive buff effects.  If you click the Enabled hotkey, it causes you to lose an AA rank and once again be disabled. Thus, you are switching between  two AA ranks. Thefore when creating an AA using this ability, you need generate both ranks. Follow the same pattern for additional ranks. See aa.cpp for further details.|
