# Bot Commands

## Description

The **bot command system** has been redesigned and is now a clone of the existing **EQEmu command system**.

Instead of using the **old operator** and **command tokens** #bot command, use the **new operator** with the **new command tokens** (i.e., ^command).

A **redirect** has also been added to the server command interpreter that will allow the use of #bot command..but, only the **new command tokens** may be used.

Many of the **commands** have been **reviewed**, **re-coded** and **improved upon**, where possible.

Since bots are an **on-going project**, some bot commands and features **may be programmed** into the server code..but, **not enabled** or **fully-realized** at this time.

As the actual bot code is **updated**, more of those commands and features can be **enabled**, as well as the addition of even **more commands**.

Please use the ^findaliases command to locate abridged versions of command names.

Using the '**help**' or '**usage**' argument after a command will show the **proper formatting** and **available options** for it.

## Actionable Bots

With specific exception, bot commands are designed to work using an '**actionable**' argument.

Some of these actionable arguments also require the use of an '**actionable name**' parameter.

The use an 'actionable' bot argument provides much **greater flexibility** and **control** over a bot or groups of bots and **eliminates the overhead of programming** multiple selection criteria into a command.

```text
target - selects target as single bot .. use ^command [target] or imply by empty actionable argument
byname [name] - selects single bot by name
ownergroup - selects all bots in the owner's group;
botgroup [name] - selects members of a bot-group by its name
targetgroup - selects all bots in target's group
namesgroup [name] - selects all bots in name's group
healrotation [name] - selects all member and target bots of a heal rotation where name is a member
healrotationmembers [name] - selects all member bots of a heal rotation where name is a member
healrotationtargets [name] - selects all target bots of a heal rotation where name is a member
spawned - selects all spawned bots
all - selects all spawned bots .. argument use indicates en masse database updating
```

Only those **bots owned by the commanding player** can be **selected** for any **bot command use**.

## Example

```text
usage: (<friendly_target>) ^follow ([option: reset]) [actionable: byname | ownergroup | botgroup | namesgroup | healrotation | spawned] ([actionable_name])
```

* ^follow reset spawned - resets all spawned bots to follow their default assignments
* ^follow byname Jojo - Set the bot 'Jojo' to follow the selected friendly target
* ^follow botgroup Mybotgroup - Sets all spawned members of the bot-group 'Mybotgroup' to follow the selected friendly target
* ^follow ownergroup - Sets all bots within the owner's group to follow the selected friendly target

**Target selection is optional** if the argument preceding the command is enclosed in parentheses. In this case, an **omitted actionable argument** should default to the **bot's owner**.

If there is **no argument** preceding the command, then the selected target is **not required**, and hence, ignored.

Optional '**options**' and '**actionable**' arguments are also **enclosed within parentheses**.
