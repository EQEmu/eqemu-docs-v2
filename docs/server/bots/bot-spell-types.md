    0 (Nuke) - 21 (Pre-Combat Buff Song) are the original "Parent Types" and 22 (Fear) - 57 (Pet Resist Buffs) are "Sub Types". It is recommended for organizational purposes to place spells in the appropriate parent or sub type but is not required for proper functionality. Bot spell code will check the appropriate parent type for a spell if the sub type or commanded list is empty. Disciplines require being placed in the Discipline (200) list at minimum.
